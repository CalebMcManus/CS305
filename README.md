Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client is ARtemis Financial, who offers service to their customers to help them make financial decisions and financial plans, and they are wanting us to create a secure method to store and send information securely.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
AFter looking for the security risk, I did the research as a way to find a way to help cover that security hole, usually by updating or rolling back versions. It's important to code securely as to not allow any information 
to be passed unsecurely and allow unathorized parties gain access to information. With the information detected, it builds the trust between the customer and the company which keeps profits up and protects the company 
from cyber attacks.
